## Overview
I made Cubix as my final project for CPSC 3520: Intro to Videogame Development. I worked hard on it for the time that I was able to, and as a result, it was voted class favorite.  
Cubix is a short puzzle platformer game centered around two playable Cubie characters in which the player's only goal is to use their surroundings to get both Cubies to their appropriate exits.
It features custom sprites and is written using the LWJGL 3 library for Java SE 11.
## Installation Instructions
1. Download the zip file from github, extract the install folder (labeled Cubix, contains a jar file and a res folder) to the desired directory.  
2. Prior to running Cubix, make sure that Java SE 11 is installed and that the PATH variable of the client machine is set to run the appropriate version of the Java runtime.
## Run Instructions
